# ngData Architecture
This repository contains the design iterations for the ngData architecture.

# Iterations Summary
* [Iteration 0](https://github.com/whiteheaddmark/ngData-Architecture/blob/master/iterations/Iteration0.md) - Initial partitioning into a layered architecture based on previous ARDG work and application of Template Method Pattern and Dependency Inversion Principle.
* [Iteration 1](https://github.com/whiteheaddmark/ngData-Architecture/blob/master/iterations/Iteration1.md) - Refined ideas presented in Iteration 1 by establishing the conceptual domain model and providing more detail related to the template method idea.
* [Iteration 2](https://github.com/whiteheaddmark/ngData-Architecture/blob/master/iterations/Iteration2.md) - Incorporate process view into conceptual domain model.
