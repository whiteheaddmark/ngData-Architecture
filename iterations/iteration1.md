# Iteration 1
The overall goal is to establish a conceptual architecture for offline data processing. Previously, we considered a subset of the drivers and selected design concepts to address those drivers. In this iteration, we begin to define the conceptual domain model and consider how the design concepts would influence a hypothetical implementation.

# Design Concepts

# Conceptual Domain Model
The layered architecture suggested in Iteration 0 is a technically partitioned architecture (as opposed to a domain-partitioned architecture). This means that groups of concepts, rather than being grouped by domain (such as solicitation or proposal), are grouped by their technical role in the architecture (such as Scientific Software or Infrastructure). In this context, we begin to establish the conceptual domain model for the Scientific Software layer to define the language we will use in subsequent iterations.
